# 2D Platformer FSM for godot
A 2D Platformer Character with a Finite State Machine for godot

Here's a diagram:
![States](https://github.com/BuzzL123/2D-Platformer-FSM-godot-/blob/main/Screenshots/Screenshot%202025-04-25%20163352.png)

To be fixed:
  - Jab! state is more like a self harm state. So I need to mess around with signals and Area2D nodes.
  - make the NPC Jabbable and able to dammage the Player

To be added:
  - Throwing knife
  - make dash an attack state?
  - Dash jump?
  - A jab attack from the above (will be able to stun?)
  - Stun
  - Ledge Climb
  - Attack Chaining or Combos
  - Health Indacator
  - momentum?
  - hit particles (or just an indecator)

To learn how to make a FSM, used the tutorial by **The Shaggy Dev**:
